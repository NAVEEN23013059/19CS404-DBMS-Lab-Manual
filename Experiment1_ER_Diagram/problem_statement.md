## RESULT
The ER model successfully captures the core components of a city library management system, including members, books, librarians, staff, borrowing records, fines, and administrative operations. It clearly defines:

Entities such as MEMBER, BOOK, LIBRARIAN, STAFF, BORROW RECORD, FINE, SECTION, and CATALOG.

Relationships like BORROWS, ISSUES, RETURNS, MANAGES, and MAINTAINS to represent the interactions between entities.

Attributes that support efficient tracking of book details, borrowing history, fine amounts, and member information.

Constraints (1:N, M:N) that accurately reflect real-world library operations, enabling many-to-many or one-to-many relationships as needed.
